        <h1>My Favorite Book</h1>
        <p>Growing up in Chicago, I was intergrated into a very diverse community.</p> 
        <p>This allowed me the privilege of exchanging ideas with people of nearly every culutural background.</p> 
        <p>This wide array of different idealogies culminating together has shaped my mentality, and as a result, reading preferences </p> 
        <h2>All Time Favorites</h2>
